Information provided by Airbnb
The dataset that Airbnb provides has three sub-datasets, which is:
A Calendar dataset where we can see the availability of a certain listing and the corresponding price.
A Listing dataset with a full description of listings
A Reviews dataset with information about the review from each guess.


## the questions that we are trying to answer: 
What are the factors that have the most effect on the price?
What is the best month based on availability?
What is the best month based on the price?
What is the best neighborhood based on availability?
What is the best neighborhood based on the price?

## Conclusions
the number of accommodates, bedrooms, bathrooms, beds and guests included are determining the price.
January is the most available month of the year.
the first two months of the year has the less price.
Roxhill, Fairmount park and holly park are the top 3 neighborhoods in which you can have a lot of available options.
the most expensive neighborhood is Fairmount Park, and the least prices are in Roxhill neighborhood.
Roxhill is the best choice if you want more options and less price.
